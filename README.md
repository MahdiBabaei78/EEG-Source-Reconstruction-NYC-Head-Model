# EEG-Source-Reconstruction-NYC-Head-Model
This repository includes MATLAB scripts to read EEG data, compute dipole powers with the NYC head model, and visualize results on the NYC brain using a custom UI. The UI includes a time slider for precise result viewing. Some scripts are modified versions of Fieldtrip toolbox scripts.
