How to use the Main_Script:
1. Download the NYC head model MATLAB structure from the following link:
https://www.parralab.org/nyhead/sa_nyhead.mat

2. Download the Fieldtrip toolbox (Our functions are compatible with version 2023-01-18 of the Fieldtrip toolbox)

3. Find a sample EEG dataset in .edf format.

4. RUn the Main_Script From the first section in order.

CAUTIONS:

1. The EEG data should be in .edf format. Otherwise, the code might not be able to read it.

2. The EEG data should already be preprocessed. This code does not preprocess the data.

3. If you are going to use the frequency analysis method (available in the Spont_Analysis function and the 
first analysis type of the Evoked_Analysis function), ensure that the window length contains at least 3 
periods of all desired frequencies. For example, to check the 10 Hz frequency, the window length must be 
equal to or greater than 0.3 seconds.

4. It is obvious that the trial length must be greater than the window length.

5. If you are going to run the code multiple times in a for loop, consider that the MATLAB `
save('variable name')` function might not be able to save large files, especially those larger than 2GB.

6. In the timelock analysis (analysis type 2 of the Evoked_Analysis function), the mean of the covariance
 matrices is not subtracted. In long window lengths, this action will make the data have zero mean in each
 channel. This is not necessary because the data is assumed to be preprocessed previously, so a common 
 average reference might have been used. Additionally, this will prevent the powers from being almost zero
 when the window length is 1, 3, or 6 samples long. Thus, the result would be valid when we are about to 
 have smaller windows. Consider this before using the scripts. (Line 213, Evoked_Analysis function)
